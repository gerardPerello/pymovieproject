class GameBrain:
    """A class that manages the client-side game logic, state, and socket events.

    The class encapsulates all client-side game functionalities including creating,
    joining games, and reacting to various server-side socket events like player joining,
    and new turn events. Also, it keeps the local game state and data in sync with the server.

    Attributes:
    - open_games_req: A boolean flag to keep track if open games are requested.
    - game: An instance of the game object with all relevant game settings.
    - game_id: A unique identifier for the game.
    - state: An integer representing the current game state.
    - turn: An integer representing the current turn in the game.
    - player: A player object for the current player.
    - player_id: A unique identifier for the player.
    - players: A dictionary to store information of all players participating in the game.
    - open_games: A dictionary to store information about all open games available for joining.
    - game_started: A boolean flag indicating whether the game has started or not.
    - stocks: A dictionary to store information about stocks in the game.
    - currencies: A dictionary to store information about currencies in the game.
    - sio: An instance of the socket.io client to manage real-time communication with the server.
